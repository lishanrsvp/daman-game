Big-Small is a classic dice game that has been a favorite among Daman Game players for its simplicity and exciting gameplay. This comprehensive guide will teach you everything you need to know to master this timeless game.

## Understanding Big-Small

Big-Small is a dice game where players bet on whether the sum of three dice will be "Big" (11-18) or "Small" (3-10). The game also offers additional betting options for specific numbers and combinations.

## Game Rules and Betting Options

### Main Bets

## Basic Strategy for Beginners
